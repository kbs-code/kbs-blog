Why study communication?  Haven't I been communicating for my entire life?  I'm good, right?
Not necessarily.  [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) may be at play here, and [Warren Buffet said](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/warren-buffett-says-mastering-this-1-skill-will-separate-you-from-crowd.html) that the most important skill for succeeding in business is communication.  

The importance of communication is stated nicely by Rebecca Fielding, a recruiter and company owner, who is featured in the course:

*"There are very few jobs that you can do without needing to communicate with colleagues or with customers. In fact, I can't really even think of one, to be honest."*

Registering for the course was easy, and completely free.  

As I worked through Week 1, I noticed that the course frequently cites studies and academic papers.  It was nice to see that what I was being taught was based on evidence:

At the end of week 1, I was asked to complete a quiz, which was a mixture of fill-in-the-blank, select one or more, and multiple choice.  There were a few answers that I couldn't remember, so I had to go back through the course to review concepts that I forgot.  I eventually passed the quiz and moved on to Week 2. 

Week 2 followed a simmilar structure of Week 1, but the material was focused on active listening, and proper questioning.  As with Week 1, there were parts where I would have to watch a video and write feedback on what I thought about the video in a response text box.

For me personally, the most important concept from Week 2 was the idea of active listening because it made me realize that I had been listening too passively, without giving feedback such as nodding or small verbal statements such as "mhmm".
