I wanted to prepare to enter the workforce in some sort of Administrative Assistant / Data Entry / Customer Service capacity.  Microsoft Excel has been such an important tool for Data Analysis, Accounting, and other departments in buisnesses for many years now.  Therefore, I looked online for courses that would help me learn the more advanced features of Excel that were to new to me.  I found "MO-211: Microsoft Excel Expert (Microsoft 365 Apps)" by Phillip Burton on Udemy.  It was included as part of a one week trial of Udemy's "Personal Plan" subscription.  If you're subscribed, you get access to all courses and certificates for about thirty dollars a month.  Pretty neat.  

One of the first things the instructor explained about the structure of the course was there would be practice excercises and quizzes.  This is great.  Without excercises, there is not as much mental reinforcement of the instructors verbal instructions.  If you also choose to work through this course, I highly recommend that you do every single excercise and quiz.  You will be less useful in Excel if you skip them.  

My first prompt to download resources were at the end of a video.  I couldn't miss it.  I didn't have to search in other places throughout the course to locate the excercises and sample workbooks.  This is really great since I saved minutes of time and frustration.

Pretty soon after I started working in Section 2 of the course, I realized that the videos were packed with information.  This is good in terms of value, but only if the watcher is very disciplined and pauses the video after something useful is said.  The video will not pause for you.  The course will not give you a quiz each time the instructor says something useful.  It is up to you to pause the video and test out what the instructor said in the included workbook.

One issue I experienced was that I couldn't access a feature shown in the course called "Version History".  It was because I was using Excel 2021, not Excel 365.  My version had a simillar feature called "History", and I wasn't able to access versioning at all.  I did some Googling, was unable to find the answer, so I submitted a question in Microsoft's community page.

While I was waiting for my question to be answered, I continued to work through a section that explained how to protect sheets and cell ranges with passwords.

You may have noticed that I am documenting my learning process in this blog *as I am working through the course*.  I'm not working through the entire course in it's entirety, then writing about it later.  Why?  Well, I thought that:

<ul>

a. Blogging about the process while I was doing the process would make the final accounting of the process more detailed and contain less errors.  Or, it would save time and frustration resulting from choosing to write the blog post later, forgetting some details, then going back to the course to recover the details I lost.

b. This wasn't my intent, but I realized that by pausing the video frequently to write, I was taking breaks from the content, and I was taking these breaks, I was forgetting a few details of the video I saw minutes before.  Writing about what I saw, then returning to the video, rewinding a few minutes to review what I just learned helped reinforce what I learned.  This was one of the tactics I had learned from reading [Peak](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Secrets-New-Science-Expertise-ebook/dp/B011H56MKS) by Anders Eriksson.  In that book, the authors teach that effective practice involves tons of learning, then reviewing, over and over again until you remove uncertanties.  In my case, just watching this Udemy course and saying "That's It!" wouldn't have been optimal.  I needed to watch the video, pause, try to do some task in Excel, fail the task, *then go back to the video to review what I had failed to grasp*.

</ul>

The first quiz was taken in the second half of Section 2, and I got 3 out of 4 correct.  The course told me that I should go to the question I got wrong and review it.  I think this feature could be improved by including a link to the content in the course where the material in question is taught.

After the quiz, there was the first practice activity.  I was presented with 2 workbooks that I had to download.  The course asked me to accomplish a few small tasks that were explained earlier in the course. I didn't accomplish all of the tasks easily, so I viewed the solutions video, then went back and tried the same tasks again.

Next was Section 3 which covered formatting and validating data.  Of particular usefulness was the section on formatting dates and times.  For example the date of of "2023-10-13-8-08" would be formatted as "yyyy-m-d-h-mm".

Section 4 covered PivotTables and PivotCharts.  I had no idea what these were, but I knew they were important because skills in these features were often asked of me by recruiters.  

The instructor then blazed through common PivotTable operations without giving a background on PivotTables or why they're important.  Maybe Microsoft could enlightmen me:

*"You can use a PivotTable to summarize, analyze, explore, and present summary data."*

(Sarcastically)Thanks, Microsoft.
